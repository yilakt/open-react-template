          GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other
          mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your
          browsing activities, and use of the Services. We may combine this
          “activity information” with other personal data that we collect about
          you. Generally, we use this activity information to understand how our
          Services are used, track bugs and errors, improve our Services, verify
          account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and
          protect our Services, as well as for targeted marketing and
          advertising purposes, to personalize content and for analytics
          purposes. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how
          we collect and use activity information, see our Cookie Policy .
          Do-Not-Track. Please note we do not respond to browser do-not-track
          requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in
          the applicable Cookie Policy. SOCIAL MEDIA If you participate in
          various social media forums like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Yammer,
          Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc., you should be familiar with and
          understand the tools provided by those sites that allow you to make
          choices about how you share the personal data in your social media
          profile(s). Please note that the relevant privacy practices or
          policies of these third parties – not this Policy – apply to the
          processing of data by these tools, so we encourage you to read the
          applicable privacy notices, terms of use and related information about
          how your personal data is used in these social media environments.
          Also, depending on the choices you have made regarding your settings
          on various social media sites (and/or in combination with your
          settings on the ONEPACE LLC pages), certain personal data may be
          shared with ONEPACE LLC about your online activities and social media
          profiles (e.g., interests, marital status, gender, username, photo,
          comments and content you have posted/shared etc.). IF YOU ARE UNDER 16
          YEARS OF AGE Our online services are not directed to children under 13
          years of age. If you believe we have collected information about a
          child under the age of 13 without a legal basis, please contact us
          (see ‘Data Protection Officer - Contact and Queries’ below) so that we
          may take appropriate steps to delete such information. If you are at
          least 13 but under 16 years of age, you must get the consent of your
          parent or legal guardian before you give us any personal data about
          yourself. Your parent or guardian should contact the ONEPACE LLC
          company responsible for using your personal data – the overview of the
          applicable ONEPACE LLC companies can be found here - and provide us
          with their name, e-mail address and any other identifying information
          that we may request. ONEPACE LLC needs this information in order to
          verify that they have provided the necessary consent. We may follow up
          by phone or other means in some circumstances. If you are at least 13
          but under 16 years of age, do not contact us or provide us with any
          personal data until after your parent or guardian has sent us an
          e-mail consenting to your contact and provision of such information.
          INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA Please be informed that
          we transfer and process any personal data you provide to us to
          countries other than your country of residence. The laws of these
          countries may not provide an equivalent level of protection to your
          personal data as the laws in your home country. ONEPACE LLC will
          therefore seek to ensure that all adequate safeguards are in place and
          that all applicable laws and regulations are complied with in
          connection with such transfer. For data transferred from the European
          Economic Area (‘EEA’) or United Kingdom to countries outside the
          EEA/UK that do not provide an adequate level of protection, ONEPACE
          LLC is using Intra Group Data Transfer Agreements based on the EU
          Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission
          (‘Standard Contractual Clauses’) and other local legal transfer
          provisions. With respect to transfers from the EEA and UK to parties
          outside the ONEPACE LLC group companies, ONEPACE LLC will base the
          transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as the Standard Contractual
          Clauses or other approved data transfer or certification mechanisms,
          together with binding and enforceable commitments by the recipient. In
          each instance, ONEPACE LLC will assess the transfer and ensure that
          any additional technical and organizational measures are put in place
          to ensure that an adequate level of protection is provided. SECURITY
          ONEPACE LLC has implemented technical, physical, and organizational
          measures and controls designed to protect the personal data we collect
          against unauthorised or unlawful use, alteration, unauthorised access
          or disclosure, accidental or wrongful destruction, and loss. Please be
          aware that despite our efforts, no security measures can guarantee
          absolute security. In addition, you can also take certain steps to
          protect your account and your personal data, for example, not reusing
          passwords across multiple websites, choosing passwords that are not
          easily guessed, and promptly reporting any suspicious activity or
          unauthorized account access. DATA RETENTION ONEPACE LLC retains your
          personal data for as long as required to satisfy the purpose for which
          they were collected and used (for example, for the time necessary for
          us to send you the newsletters you subscribed to, to provide you with
          customer service, answer queries or resolve technical problems, etc.),
          unless a longer period is necessary for our legal obligations or to
          defend a legal claim. If you have created an OneONEPACE LLC account or
          another ONEPACE LLC account with us, we will delete such account and
          your personal data upon your request or 30 days after it has become
          inactive. We will consider your account ‘inactive’ when you haven’t
          used your OneONEPACE LLC account or another ONEPACE LLC account for a
          period of 2 years. Before your account becomes inactive, we will
          notify you to use your OneONEPACE LLC or another ONEPACE LLC account
          to prevent your account from becoming inactive. When we close your
          account, your personal data will be deleted, unless you are using the
          IdeasForDates app, in which case your training and running data will
          be stored for an additional 4 years after your account becomes
          inactive (unless you ask us to delete your data earlier). Also, if we
          need to store certain types of your personal data for a longer period
          due to legal requirements, we will store such data in accordance with
          the mandatory periods. YOUR RIGHTS You may, subject to applicable law,
          have the following rights concerning your personal data: right of
          access, right of rectification, right to erasure, right to restrict
          data processing, right to object against profiling and your right to
          data portability. If you would like to exercise any of these rights,
          please contact the ONEPACE LLC company responsible for using your
          personal data. An overview of all contact details can be found here.
          To the extent that we are relying on our legitimate interests to use
          your personal data, you also have the right to object to such use
          (unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for
          the use that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we
          need to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of
          legal claims). We will respond to your privacy rights request
          consistent with applicable law. For your and the protection of others,
          we may (depending on the type of request) need to verify your request
          and identity before addressing your request. You may revoke your
          consent for receiving marketing communications at any time, free of
          charge by following the instructions in any marketing communication.
          You can also control these preferences in your profile settings. If
          you wish to revoke your consent to ONEPACE LLC using your health data
          and location data, you can contact the ONEPACE LLC company responsible
          for using your personal data (an overview can be found here). You can
          also control these preferences in your profile settings and device. In
          case you may have a question or complaint about how we process your
          personal data, you can send an email to the ONEPACE LLC company
          responsible for using your personal data (an overview can be found
          here). Alternatively, you may consider lodging a complaint with a
          supervisory data protection authority. Users in certain jurisdictions
          may have different additional privacy rights as specified under the
          Location Deviation section below. LOCAL DEVIATION In the following
          jurisdictions, additional or different rules and rights apply to those
